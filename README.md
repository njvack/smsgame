## SMSgame -- a simple text-mesaging-based behavioral study

Written for Aaron Heller's dissertation at the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior, this is a simple economic game to probe the effects of savoring and rumination in natural settings.

Periodically, participants answer a question about their positive and negative feeling. Once per day, participants are asked to play a game in which they guess whether a random number from 1-9 is less then or greater than 5. If they guess correctly, they win some amount of money. After this, we sample their feelings more often.

In a this variant of the game, participants' wins will reward *other people* that the participants have chosen beforehand. We send a message indicating which participant will get the money. Or not, if they lose.
